For each user we assign a role and the role determines the access rights of the user. The roles are dynamically defined by the Administrator of the business along with details of what modules can be accessed by the person with that role. The access to the system from outside business network is through 128 bit encryption supported by Digital Certificates. The Business system admin generates the digital certificates and issues them to the users that need to access the system remotely. It is also very easy to remove the users if they quit working in the business.</p>

                                                <p>a) Internet Backup option: In this option Insta takes the backup. The cost is low but this is only workable for small database sizes.</p>
                                                <p>b) Hot Backup option: The primary backup may be taken on the secondary disk on the same server. Additional cost is the cost of the secondary disk. Q-BIZ Data center can be used for disaster backup, but for larger data, a manual backup process is a must.</p>
                                                <p>c) High Availability Pair: A secondary server is used to keep the backup in addition to be ing a standby that can be used when the primary fails. Additional cost is that of the server. Disaster recovery is same as for the HB option.</p>
